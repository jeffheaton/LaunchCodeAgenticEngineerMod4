# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a Docker-based development environment for LaunchCode's **Agentic Programming** course, Module 4.

## Docker Commands

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t agentic_engineer_4 .
```

Force a clean rebuild:
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t agentic_engineer_4 .
```

Run with a local workspace mounted (recommended):
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -p 8502:8502 \
  -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-token \
  -e SLACK_TEAM_ID=your-team-id \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  agentic_engineer_4
```

Pull and run the pre-built image from DockerHub:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -v "$PWD":/workspace heatonresearch/agentic_engineer_4:latest
```

## MCP Servers

Two MCP servers are pre-installed and configured in `/root/.claude/settings.json`:

### Slack
- Package: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack`
- Requires env vars: `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_TEAM_ID`
- Allows Claude Code prompts to read channels, post messages, and interact with Slack workspaces.

### Gmail
- Package: `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`
- OAuth credentials stored in `/root/.gmail-mcp/` (persist this directory across container runs if needed)
- Allows Claude Code prompts to read, search, and send Gmail messages.

## Skills

Pre-configured skills (invoked with `/skill-name` in Claude Code):

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `/send-slack-message` | Send a message to a Slack channel |
| `/check-gmail` | Summarize recent unread Gmail messages |
| `/send-email` | Draft and send an email via Gmail |
| `/summarize-session` | Bullet-point summary of the current session |
| `/rebuild-and-deploy` | Rebuild the Docker image and push it to DockerHub |

Skills are defined in `settings.json` which is copied to `/root/.claude/settings.json` during image build.

## Agents

Pre-configured sub-agents available inside Claude Code sessions. Agents are autonomous specialists that Claude Code can invoke automatically or that you can request explicitly.

| Agent | Description |
|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews recent git changes for quality, security, and maintainability |
| `email-summarize` | Checks new Gmail messages and posts sender + 2-line summary to #test Slack channel |

Agents are defined as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `/root/.claude/agents/` inside the container. Source files live in the `agents/` directory of this repo and are copied in at build time.

**Running an agent:**

Ask Claude Code to use the agent explicitly:
```
Review my recent changes using the code-reviewer agent.
```

Or Claude Code may invoke it automatically when the task matches the agent's description.

## Running Streamlit Apps

From inside the container:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Access at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Key Dependencies (requirements.txt)

- `anthropic` — Claude API client
- `streamlit` — web UI framework
- `python-dotenv` — environment variable management
- `slack_sdk` — Slack integration (Python)
- `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-oauthlib` — Gmail/Google API access (Python)
- `fastapi`, `flask`, `uvicorn` — web frameworks
- `pydantic`, `httpx` — HTTP and data validation

## Environment & Tools in the Container

- Python 3.12 (aliased as `python` and `pip`)
- Claude Code CLI (`claude`) installed globally via npm
- OpenCode (`opencode-ai`) installed globally via npm
- MCP server: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack`
- MCP server: `@gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp`
- ngrok for tunneling
- Workspace mounted at `/workspace`

## Gmail API Setup

Place `credentials.json` (from Google Cloud Console) in your workspace directory. On first run it triggers OAuth and saves `token.json`. Both files should be in `.gitignore`.
